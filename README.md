# ATLAS-Extract-Plugin
Plugin for ATLAS dedicated server to extract resources, bosses, and other imporant data.

This requires nodejs installed https://nodejs.org/en/

This must be ran on windows due to the inability to run plugins on Linux.

Run `prereq.bat` to install the server, plugins, and configuration.
Install your servergrid.json file to `DumpResources\server\ShooterGame`.

Run `build_json.js` and once all grids are processed the output will be in `./json`.
